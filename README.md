## Support Me

I will **never** charge money for the use of my plugins, however they do require a significant amount of work to
maintain and update. If you'd like to show your support and buy me a cup of tea sometime (I don't drink that horrid
coffee stuff :P) you can do so [here](https://www.paypal.me/zerthick)
